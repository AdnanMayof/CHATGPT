## Project 1: Sales Performance Analysis

### Objective: 
Analyze sales data to identify trends, sales performance over time, and customer buying patterns.

### Questions to Explore:
1. What are the top-performing products in terms of sales and revenue?
2. Which geographical regions are generating the most sales?
3. Are there any seasonal trends in sales data? If so, how can these trends be leveraged to increase sales?
4. What is the average transaction value over different time periods (daily, monthly, yearly)?
5. How have sales strategies implemented in the past affected the sales performance?
6. Can any correlations be found between different types of products being bought together?

   - Source sales data from an open dataset or a simulated dataset containing information like transaction ID, date, customer ID, product ID, quantity, and sales amount.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation (Excel/SQL):**
   - Clean and organize data using Excel (for instance, using functions like VLOOKUP, pivot tables) or SQL queries.
   - Create calculated fields such as monthly sales, quarterly sales, and yearly sales.

3. **Data Visualization (Tableau/Power BI):**
   - Develop interactive dashboards to visualize sales trends over time.
   - Use Tableau or Power BI to create visualizations like bar graphs, line charts, and heat maps to identify patterns and insights.
